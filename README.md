# Reviewnotes

Bash script to review markdown notes line by line 

* Created because in 2023 I began to take notes via markdown in order to get more familar with vi, git, and git-bash
* To also encourage me to review these notes daily I made this little script to read out the lines notes 
* Enter will produce the next line.
* Will add some samples files for formatting however essentially the markdown notes consist of # for headers
* * For bullets 
* 1. For numbered list
